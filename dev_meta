# TODO #
- tasks
  [ ] self.action_change_card and self.flip_card are ✨ semi redundant ✨
  - maybe make a self.question and self.answer for the current card,
  kinda reduces code duplication

- features
  [ ] label that says if the question is being shown or not
  [x] current card label

- bugs 🐞
  [x] the card wrapping feature doesn't work

1. [Install](#installation)
2. Run `cards` ðŸ’¤
3. Your `~/decks` directory will be read, and a list of decks presented
4. Pick which deck to load up, start studying! ðŸ¤“

### Decks
Flashcards are collected as "deck" files, in the directory `~/decks`. This directory is recursively checked, allowing for the decks to be categorized into subdirectories

- These deck files can be named anything, but are "Pipe (`|`) seperated values" files
- Each line in the deck file considered a [card](#cards)

### Cards
- Cards are represented as line entries in your deck file
- They are pipe (`|`) seperated, each line using the syntax `Question | Answer`
- Blank lines are ignored
- Lines starting with `#` are considered comments and also ignored
- Cards are `.strip()`ed, meaning any spaces at the end or begining of your question or answer will be trimmed off, allowing for cards like
  - `How is bexli going to get this package & publish this app when he's done? | He has no idea!`

### Keyboard shortcuts
All keyboard shortcuts can be found in the footer, expect
- `q` or `escape` to exit the app

## Usage
> **In development**: The app lacks some functionality as-is
> 
> To use the app during development, follow the [manual install](#manual) steps and read below
> 
> Anything annotated with üí§ are features yet to be implemented

1. [Install](#installation)
2. Create `~/decks` directory, create your [deck](#decks) files
3. Run `cards` üí§
4. Pick which deck to load up, start studying! ü§ì

### Decks
Flashcards are collected as "deck" files, in the directory `~/decks`. This directory is recursively checked, allowing for the decks to be categorized into subdirectories

- These deck files can be named anything, but are "Pipe (`|`) seperated values" files
- Each line in the deck file considered a [card](#cards)
- Check out this [example deck](sample_deck.txt)

#### Custom *Deck Path*
If you don't like `~/decks`, and directory can be specified. Simply set an environment variable for `DECK_PATH`
- `export DECK_PATH=path/to/deck/files` ‚Üê Add to your shell rc Linux/MacOS
- [Windows instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.3#saving-environment-variables-with-the-system-control-panel)

### Cards
- are represented as line entries in your deck file
- are pipe (`|`) seperated, each line using the syntax `Question | Answer`
- ignore blank lines
- ignore lines starting with `#` (comments)
- can be styled with Rich's "[Console Markup](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markup.html)"
  - for example `The [green]mitochondria[/] is the _____ of the cell?`
- ignore trailing and leading whitespace (tabs, spaces), allowing for cards like
  - `How is bexli going to get this package & publish this app when he's done? | He has no idea!`

### Keyboard shortcuts
All keyboard shortcuts can be found in the footer, expect
- `q` or `escape` to exit the app
